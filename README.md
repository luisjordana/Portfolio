## Education
**Professional Education, Data Science | MIT Professional (_January 2023- April 2023_)**
- Theory of several **data science techniques** including Deep Learning, Unsupervised and Supervised Learning, Graphs, Recommendation Systems, Exploratory Data analysis, and Forecasts among others.
- **Applications of such techniques using Python.** 

**Ph.D., Human Movement Sciences | Universidade de Lisboa (_January 2019- April 2023_)**
- Created a **shooting and pass availability** method for **real in-game football data**. 
- I researched **defensive coordination in football**, analyzing **player movements** to uncover strategies for enhancing team defense.
- I conducted an experiment **modeling coordination** among participants, introducing antagonistic instructions to simulate competition dynamics. This involved developing a **small competitive mathematical model** to inform the expected results in such an antagonistic setting.
 
**Research Master, Human Movement Sciences | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (_September 2015- June 2017_)**
- The **master's included a year of classes** where I learned about different aspects of Human Movement Science, such as Motor Diseases, Muscle Neuroscience, Micro Biology of the Bones and Muscles, Modelling of Muscle Synergies, etc...
- The **second year was a research project aiming for publication**. I researched the usability of **immersive virtual reality** to study symptoms of **Parkinson’s Disease**. This led to the publication of **two peer-reviewed papers**. 
- **Hypothesis testing**, and **supervised learning** (linear regression) using R.
- **Kinetic modeling** using **Matlab**.
- Application of **unsupervised learning** techniques such as **PCA**.
   
**Bachelor, Psychology | Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (_September- June 2015_)**
- I excel in **statistics** during my **Bachelor's Degree**, obtaining outstanding grades.
- My **Bachelor’s Thesis** was published in a **peer-reviewed journal**. 

## Work Experience
**Senior Consultant in Big Data @ Atrevia (_May 2023- Present_)**
- **Data analysis** of **online conversations**, **reviews**, and **news feeds** to generate reports that inform business decisions. 
- **Data scrapping** and **processing** of online sources using **Python**. 
- **Data categorization** using **Chat-GPT API** and **NLP** techniques.

**Statistics Tutor (SPSS  and R) @ Self-Employed (Lima, Perú) (_Septiembre 2017- June 2018_)**
- I gave classes in **Statistics** to students of Sociology, Psychology, and similar fields.
- The classes were mainly focused on the usage of **SPSS**, and **R** for **hypothesis testing**, and **exploratory data analysis**.
- Additionally, I help them **write** and **strengthen** the **methodology** of their Bachelor’s thesis.

**Member of the Organization Committee @ 6th Iberian Congress of Perception (_April 2015- June 2015_)**
